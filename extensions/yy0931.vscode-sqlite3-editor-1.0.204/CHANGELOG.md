## Diff Editor
You can now view side-by-side comparisons of two database versions in the source control view. To see the differences between the versions, click "Compare database with local file."

# 1.0.67
The following changes have been made in this update:

## Document Formatter
You can now format queries by selecting "Format Document" in the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) or by pressing Shift+Alt+F.\
This feature uses [sql-formatter](https://github.com/sql-formatter-org/sql-formatter) to format queries.

## Buttons to Select CTEs
To make it easier to create a complex query involving [CTEs](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html), we have added buttons that enable you to display the output of each CTE.

## Syntax Validator
We have added a syntax validator to the query editor. To achieve this, we [prepare](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/prepare.html) (or compile) each statement in the editor and check for syntax errors. However, some PRAGMAs does their work when the statement is prepared [1], so we do not check them for syntax errors.

[1] "Some PRAGMA statements do ..." in https://www.sqlite.org/lang_explain.html#explain_operates_at_run_time_not_at_prepare_time

## Other Changes
- We added left padding to row numbers to ensure the row number column has the same width regardless of the scroll position.

To help users adjust column width quickly, we have added the "Autofit Column Width" button to the table header.
